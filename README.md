Jockey Express
Group Project 2
-- Horse racing management app

Getting Started
Before this course, I explain a little bit about coding to my mother. She mentioned her business with horse racing and how she wanted a cleaner way to manage her business. 

###Prerequisites

She wanted a website that functions as a database and accessible site for all her horse related business. This would allow her to manage all the horses she owns, and track the earnings.

Upon thinking about this, I thought of some additions to this online database for her by adding the last 3 rankings of the last 3 races, having an active/non-active list, separate last earnings and total earnings, turf/dirt list, and adding links to licensing, horse naming, and registering for races.

We will use MySQL for the database and use Node and Express.js to allow the user to post/read/update/and delete information. 

We also would like to make a database which acts as a jockey roster so she can see which jockeys ride their horses and which horses they ride as well. 

Our goal is to make this site an all for one shop to allow horse owners to look at their horse roster, Create/Read/Update/Delete aspects of the database, while also allowing her to easily access the links to register her new horses' names, obtain and renew licensing, and register horses for races. Also adding a side roster of the jockeys too.

Future Plans
We hope to make this site as user friendly and accessible to someone like my mom who is not a tech person, to easily manage her business. 

Deployment
This site can be viewed in all forms of media; tablet, computer, and phone without hurting the eyes.
